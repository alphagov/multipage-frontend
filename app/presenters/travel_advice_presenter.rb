  # FIXME: Update publishing app UI and remove from content
  # Change description is used as "Latest update" but isn't labelled that way
  # in the publisher. The frontend didn't add this label before.
  # This led to users appending (in a variety of formats)
  # "Latest update:" to the start of the change description. The frontend now
  # has a latest update label, so we can strip this out.
  # Avoids: "Latest update: Latest update - â€¦"
